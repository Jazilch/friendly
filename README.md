# **Friendly**

Friendly was created to try and solve the problem of viewing friends calendars. Many of our friends wanted to visit us in Dublin but didn't know when we were going to be away or in Dublin. Instead of texting us or trying to use Google Calendar we decided to come up with Friendly. 

This app will hopefully allow our friends to easily view our calendar on when we will be in Dublin and be able to book time on our calendar. 

## **Future To-Dos**
1. Create a status system for approved calendar invites
1. Able to fetch real data from API
1. Allow our friends to login so they can create their own calendar
